name: Polygons from Points
author:
  - name: Simon Pahls

description: "Script takes a csv file containing longitudinal and latitudinal coordinates of point observations and transforms them into polygons by applying a bufferzone around each point and then fusing them. The output is a shapefile containing these polygons"

inputs:
  obs:
    label: Observations
    description: directory of .csv file containing the observational data. Must only contain two columns called latitude and longitude
    type: text/tab-separated-values
    example:
  buffer:
    label: Buffer
    description: A number indicating the buffer zone around a point observation( in meters)
    type: int
    Example: 9500
  bbox:
    label: Boudry box
    description: Vector of float, bbox coordinates of the bbox in the order xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax
    type: float[]
    example: [0, 40, 10, 50]
outputs:
  poly:
    label: shapefile
    description: shape file containing polygons of the estimated habitat area of a population
