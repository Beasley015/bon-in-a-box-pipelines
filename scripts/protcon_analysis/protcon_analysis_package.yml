inputs:
  study_area_polygon:
    label: Polygon of study area
    description: Represents the map of the study area
    type: application/geo+json
  protected_area_polygon:
    label: Polygon of protected areas
    description: Represents the map of the protected areas within the study area
    type: application/geo+json
  studyarea_epsg:
    label: study area EPSG
    description: Numerical value referring to the EPSG code (European Petroleum Survey Group) associated with the spatial reference system that will be used as a reference for the study area. This numerical value specifies the projection and geodetic datum used to define the coordinates and spatial representation of the data in the study area. For further information on coordinate systems and EPSG codes, you can access the official database on the EPSG website at https://epsg.org/home.html. The website provides documentation, resources, and tools for searching and understanding the EPSG codes used in various geospatial contexts.
    type: int
    example: 3395
  unit_distance:
    label: unit for distance measurement
    description: String value that defines the measurement unit for calculating distances between spatial units (m or km) and estimating their areas (m2 or km2) in the study area.
    type: options
    options:
      - "m2"
      - "km2"
    example: "m2"
  distance_threshold:
    label: distance analysis threshold
    description: Refers to the threshold distance used to estimate if the areas are connected in a spatial analysis. This threshold represent the median dispersal probability (i.e. where the dispersal probabilty between patches is 0.5).
    type: int
    example: 10000
  distance_matrix_type:
    label: type of distance matrix
    description: String value that defines whether the user wants to use a distance matrix of centroids or the nearest edge for the ProtConn calculation
    type: options
    options:
      - "centroid"
      - "edge"
    example: "centroid"
  buffer_zone: 
    label: transboundary buffer distance
    description: transboundary buffer distance for protected areas outside of the country or region to contribute to connectivity
